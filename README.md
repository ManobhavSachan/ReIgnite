## Inspiration
In India, there is a common trend that women quits from their job after having kids. There are various reasons that may have resulted in such a trend, it may include family pressure or unavailability of required skills to apply for a particular job. In the today's competitive world where things are changing so rapidly that, even a one year gap from a professional job will result in a huge difference of experience. So, the inspiration behind the project was to make sure that women after having kids are able to get a job and get their professional career back on track. Furthermore, there is going trend of online jobs for women. The primary reason behind it is that they can manage their home including kids and the job simultaneously and easily.

## What it does
So, basically it is a website. It will be a website for the women, of the women and by the woMen(well mostly). It's name is ReIgnite (Hope you understood why). I would like to thanks Anjali for this wonderful idea and this name for our website. The main purpose of our website is to handpick all the jobs that are available for the women from various sites like linkedIn, InDeed, JobCase, etc and to bring them a plethora of courses both free and paid for them (of course handpicked) so as to make them get on track of their professional career with much ease. And also we took special care that women who are from the low income families are given the right opportunities, and so we also have a special segment of Schemes in our website which showcases all the government and NGO's scheme which will help them avail the scholarship or discount on certain courses. We are the people of the ideologies that money should not be a barrier to the education. And our last and our favourite section, blogs, yeah, how could a site be complete if it does not shows us the experience of our beloved users and participants. It will not only benefit the thinking of a person but also act as a positive source and help women motivate to move forward in life and make them believe that a rich professional career is waiting for them. So, let me make a conclusion of the question that what our site does really do. So, to get the professional life of mother get on track after having a child, our website will act as a medium to help them gain knowledge, apply for a job and avail government scheme altogether at one place only.

## How we built it
Well, with sheer amount of hard-work and with a sprinkle of luck. We built the website in a set of webpages, hence, we were able to divide the work burden properly and act fast. The front end of our website was built with help of Vs Code, namely html and css with some javascript. Now, the backend part, well I acknowledge that it was the most difficult and tricky part because our team had a limited amount of knowledge about it, was done with Mongo DataBase, node.js and SQL with MinGW. Shoutout to Ankit for his extra efforts on back end part. And so the code of various webpages was clubbed with proper database files, which resulted in Magic and boom... our beloved website of ReIgnite was borned, with a mission to help and empower women.

## Challenges we ran into
Well you know working online and coordinating on gmeet is a little tricky and not easy as it sounds. But due to a team of such supporting members we were able to do so. First of all, the doing the css part was difficult, but with the painful reading of codes again-again we were finally able to squash all (hope so) the bugs in our programme and create a working website. Secondly, the database part was like a long esteemed dreams of ours, but with every passing second we were coming closer and closer and we finally made it work. In technical terms, the problems were making a common css file for all of our pages, styling the tags was tricky. For database part, in server routing was taking a lot of time, taking user data and authentication in the backend with routing the user to main page was also giving errors and authentication was made from the scratch using passport.js on node.js.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Well to be honest, everything. From the painful hours of writing a code to designing a website, everything. We are proud, so so proud, that we were able to create a working website in such a short span of 12 hours. Achieving the backend part was also a big achievement for us. And I am proud of my team of showing such a honorary support to each other during difficult and frustrating moments also and hearing each other problems calmly and providing an effective solution to various problems.

## What we learned
Apart from management, leadership qualities, and how to actually perform together to deliver such an effective and working website in such a short span of time, is that we learned tons of html functions and their hidden functionalities that we did not knew about. We got to learn about CSS a lot and finally how to design a fluid working website with clean and lucid animations is also on the list. And coming to the database part, well, everything we did is what we learnt, we actually learnt that from the scratch. And finally, I would like to say that we learnt that we had so much talent in ourselves that we can create a beautiful and working website together.

## What's next for ReIgnite
What's next...hmm actually a lot frankly, We have built a static website and we would love to make it a dynamic website, henceforth, it would enable us to give good recommendation and facilitate our users learn only what they love and apply in their preferential jobs easily without the need of searching thoroughly. And yeah the most important, we would love to make our website community-driven website, where they can themselves add blogs, job recommendations and courses that they would stumble upon on the internet, and so benefit everyone, including to those women who have lesser technical knowledge. Furthermore, we will add a language feature so that everyone can understand the content and access it in their comfortable language.

At last, I would like to thanks GirlScript India for giving such a wonderful opportunity to us and a salute to their ever helping team members for supporting us and clarifying our doubts. I, Manobhav , would like to say that, I hope our hack was up to the standards of this esteemed hackathon. And I hope our website would play an important role in women Empowerment. Thanks a lot.......!!
